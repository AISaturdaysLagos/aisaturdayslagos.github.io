<h1 id="matrices">Matrices</h1>

<p>Vector and matrices play a central role in data science: they are probably the most common way of representing data to be analyzed and manipulated by virtually any machine learning or analytics algorithm.  However, it is also important to understand that there really two uses to matrices within data science:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Matrices are the “obvious” way to store tabular data (particularly when all the data is numeric) in an efficient manner.</li>
  <li>Matrices are the foundation of linear algebra, which the “language” of most machine learning and analytics algorithms.</li>
</ol>

<p>In is important to understand these two points but also the differences between them.  Under the first interpretation, matrices are essentially 2D arrays (vectors are 1D arrays, and tensors are higher-dimensional arrays); this view is fundamentally a take on how to efficiently store data in the multi-dimensional arrays.  But matrices are also the basic unit of linear algebra, which is a mathematical language for the expression and manipulation of linear systems of equations.  There are naturally overlaps between the two, but the core operations of linear algebra, such as matrix multiplication and solving linear systems of equations, are largely orthogonal to the way in which matrices are stored as arrays in memory.  Note: It is also the case that most (but definitely not all) treatments of tensors is data science actually don’t do much of the second: tensors are often a nice way to store higher-dimensional tabular data, but the actual linear algebra of tensors is relatively rare despite the recent uptick of the term “tensor” in data science.</p>

<p>These notes will take us first through the “array” view of vectors and matrices, then to the “linear algebra” view.  We will then learn the basics of the <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">numpy</a> library to manipulate numpy arrays both as arrays and as matrices.  We will finish by discussing sparse matrices, which are particularly crucial for many data science applications.</p>

<h2 id="vectors-and-matrices-the-array-view">Vectors and matrices: the “array” view</h2>

<p>Vectors are 1D arrays of values.  We use the notation $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ to denote that $x$ is a vector with $n$ entries and in this case the entries are all real valued.  We can consider other types of values for vectors (and in code we will commonly create vectors of Booleans or integers), but as mathematical objects it’s most common to use real numbers.  We can write the elements of a vector more explicitly like so</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x = \left[\begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{array} \right ]</script>

<p>where we use $x_i$ to denote the $i$th element of the vector.  We also note that as far as the mathematical representation of vectors goes, we will consider vectors by default to be <em>column</em> vectors (matrices with one column and many rows), as opposed to row vectors; but for example, the Numpy library doesn’t make this distinction, so this will be largely for mathematical reasons.  If we want to denote a row vector, we’ll use the notation $x^T$ ($x$ transposed, for the transpose operator we’ll define shortly).</p>

<p>Matrices are 2D arrays of values, and we use the notation $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ to denote a matrix with $m$ rows and $n$ columns.  We can write out the elements explicitly as follows</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
A = \left[\begin{array}{cccc}
A_{11} & A_{12} & \cdots & A_{1n} \\
A_{21} & A_{22} & \cdots & A_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
A_{m1} & A_{m2} & \cdots & A_{mn}
\end{array} \right ] %]]></script>

<p>where $A_ij$ denotes the entry of $A$ in the $i$th row and $j$th column.  We will use the notation $A_{i:}$ to refer to the $i$th row of $A$ and the $A_{:j}$ to refer to the $j$th column of $A$ (whether these represent row or column vectors depends somewhat on the situation, but we will explicitly clarify which it means whenever we use such notation).</p>

<p>There are also higher order generalizations of matrices (called tensors), which represented 3D or higher arrays of values.  These are in fairly common use in modern data science, though typically (but certainly not always), tensors are just used in the “multi-dimensional array” sense, not in their true linear algebra sense.  Tensors as linear operators that act on e.g. matrices or other higher-order tensors, are slightly less common most basic data science, and are a more advanced topic that is outside the scope of this course.</p>

<h3 id="matrices-for-tabular-data-and-rowcolumn-ordering">Matrices for tabular data and row/column ordering</h3>

<p>Let’s start with a simple example representing tabular data using matrices, one of the more natural ways to represent such data (and as we will see in later lectures, one of the ways that lends itself well to use in machine learning).  Let’s consider the “Grades” table that we previously discussed in our presentation of relational data:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center">Person ID</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">HW1 Grade</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">HW2 Grade</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">5</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">85</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">95</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">6</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">80</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">60</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">100</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">100</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">100</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Ignoring the primary key column (this is not really a numeric feature, so makes less sense to store as a real-valued number), we could represent the data in the table via the matrix</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
A \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 2} = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 85 & 95 \\ 80 & 60 \\ 100 & 100 \end{array} \right ] %]]></script>

<p>While there seems to be little else that can be said at this point, there is actually a subtle but important point about how the data in this table is really laid out in memory.  Since data in memory is laid out sequentially (at least logically as far as programs are concerned, if not physically on the chip) we can opt to store the data in <em>row major order</em>, that is, storing each row sequentially</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">(85, 95, 80, 60, 100, 100)</script>

<p>or in <em>column major order</em>, storing each column sequentially</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">(85, 80, 100, 95, 60, 100)</script>

<p>Row major ordering is the default for 2D arrays in C (and the default for the Numpy library), while column major ordering is the default for FORTRAN.  There is no obvious reason to prefer one over the order, but due to the cache locality in CPU memory hierarchies, the different methods will be able to access the data more efficiently by row or by column respectively.  Most importantly, however, the real issue is that because a large amount of numerical code was originally (and still is) written in FORTRAN, if you ever want to call external numerical code, there is a good chance you’ll need to worry about the ordering.</p>

<h2 id="basics-of-linear-algebra">Basics of linear algebra</h2>

<p>In addition to serving as a method for storing tabular data, vector and matrices also provide a method for studying sets of linear equations.  These notes here are going to provide a very brief overview and summary of some of the primary linear algebra notation that you’ll need for this course.  But it is really meant to be a refresher for those who already have some experience with linear algebra previously.  If you do not, then I have previously put out an online mini-course covering (with notes) some of the basics of linear algebra: <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zkolter/course/linalg/">Linear Algebra Review</a>.  This course honestly goes a bit beyond what is needed for this particular course, but it can act a good reference.</p>

<p>Consider the following two linear equations in two variables $x_1$ and $x_2$.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{split}
4 x_1 - 5 x_2 & = -13 \\
-2 x_1 + 3 x_2 & = 9
\end{split} %]]></script>

<p>This can written compactly as the equation $A x = b$, where</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
A \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2} = \left [ \begin{array}{cc} 4 & -5 \\ -2 & 3 \end{array} \right ],
\;\; b \in \mathbb{R}^2 = \left [ \begin{array}{c} -13 \\ 9 \end{array} \right ],
\;\; x \in \mathbb{R}^2 = \left [ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{array} \right ]. %]]></script>

<p>As this hopefully illustrates, one of the entire points of linear algebra is to make the notation and math <em>simpler</em> rather than more complex.  However, until you get used to the conventions, writing large equations where the size of matrices/vectors are always implicit can be a bit tricky, so you’ll some care is needed to make sure you do not include any incorrect derivations.</p>

<h3 id="basic-operations-and-special-matrices">Basic operations and special matrices</h3>

<p><strong>Addition and substraction</strong>: Matrix addition and subtraction are applied elementwise over the matrices, and can only apply two two matrices of the same size.  That is, if $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ and $B \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ then their sum/difference $C = A + B$ is another matrix of the same size $C \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ where</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">C_{ij} = A_{ij} + B_{ij}.</script>

<p><strong>Transpose</strong>: Transposing a matrix flips its rows and columns.  That is, if $A \in \mathbb{R}^n$, then it’s transpose, denoted $C = A^T$ is a matrix $C \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ where</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">C_{ij} = A_{ji}.</script>

<p><strong>Matrix multiplication</strong>: Matrix multiplication is a bit more involved.  Unlike addition and subtraction, matrix multiplication does not perform elementwise multiplication of the two matrices.  Instead, for a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ (note these precise sizes, as they are important), their product $C = AB$ is a matrix $C \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times p}$ where</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">C_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^n A_{ik} B_{kj}.</script>

<p>In order for this sum to make sense, notice that the number of columns in $A$ must equal the number of rows in $B$.  If you’d like a bit more of the intuition behind why matrix multiplication is defined this way, the notes above provide some important interpretations.  It’s important to note the following properties, though:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Matrix multiplication is associative: $(AB)C = A(BC)$ (i.e., it doesn’t matter in what order you do the multiplications, though it <em>can</em> matter from a computational perspective, as some orderings will be more efficient to compute than others)</li>
  <li>Matrix multiplication is distributive: $A(B+C) = AB + AC$</li>
  <li>Matrix multiplication is <em>not</em> commutative: $AB \neq BA$. This is really true in two different ways.  Under the above matrix sizes, the multiplication $BA$ is not a valid expression if $m \neq p$ (since the number of columns in $B$ would not match the number of rows in $A$).  And even if the dimensions <em>do</em> match (for instance if all the matrices were $n \times n$) the products will still not be equal in general.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Identity matrix</strong>: The identity matrix $I \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is a square matrix with ones on the diagonal an zeros everywhere else</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
I = \left [ \begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & 1
\end{array} \right ]. %]]></script>

<p>It has the property that for any matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A I = I A = A</script>

<p>where we note that the two $I$ matrices in the above equations are actually two <em>different</em> sizes (the first one is $ n \times n$ and the second is $m \times m$, to make the math work right).  For this reason, some people use the notation $I_n$ to explicitly denote the size of $I$, but it is not really needed, because the size that any identity must be can be inferred from the other matrices in the equation.</p>

<p><strong>Matix inverse</strong>: For a square matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, the matrix inverse $A^{-1} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is the unique matrix such that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A^{-1}A = A A^{-1} = I.</script>

<p>The matrix inverse need not exist for all square matrices (it will depend on the linear independence between rows/columns of $A$, and we will consider such possibilities a bit later in the course.</p>

<p><strong>Solving linear equations</strong>: The matrix inverse provides an immediate method to obtain the solution to systems of linear equations.  Recall out example above of a set of linear equations $A x = b$.  If we want to find the $x$ that satisfies this equation, we multiply both sizes of the equation by $A^{-1}$ on the left to get</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A^{-1}A x = A^{-1}b \Longrightarrow x = A^{-1} b.</script>

<p>The nice thing here is that as far as we are concerned in this course, the set of equations is now <em>solved</em>.  We don’t have to worry about any actual operations that you may have learned about to actually obtain this solution (scaling the linear equations by some constant, adding/subtracting them to construct a solution, etc).  The linear algebra libraries we will use do all this for us, and our only concern is getting the solution into a form like the one above.</p>

<p><strong>Transpose of matrix product</strong>: It follows immediately from the definition of matrix multiplication and the transpose that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">(AB)^T = B^T A^T</script>

<p>i.e., the transpose of a matrix product is the product of the transposes, in reverse order.</p>

<p><strong>Inverse of matrix</strong>: It also follows immediately from the definitions that for $A,B\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ both square</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">(AB)^{-1} = B^{-1} A^{-1}</script>

<p>i.e. the inverse of a matrix product is the product of the inverses, in reverse order.</p>

<p><strong>Inner products</strong>: One type of matrix multiplication is common enough that it deserves special mention.  If $x,y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ are vectors of the same dimensions, then</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x^T y = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i</script>

<p>(the matrix product of $x$ transposed, i.e., a row vector and $y$, a column vector) is a <em>scalar</em> quantity called the inner product of $x$ and $y$; it is simply equal to the sum of the corresponding elements of $x$ and $y$ multiplied together.</p>

<p><strong>Vector norms</strong>: These are only slightly related to vectors matrices, but this seems like a good place to introduce it.  We will use the notation</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\|x\|_2 = \sqrt{x^T x} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}</script>

<p>to denote the Euclidean (also called $\ell_2$) norm of $x$.  We may occasionally also refer to the $\ell_1$ norm</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\|x\|_1 = \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i|</script>

<p>or the $\ell_\infty$ norm</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\|x\|_\infty = \max_{i=1,\ldots,n} |x_i|.</script>

<p>** Complexity of operations**:  For making efficient use of matrix operations, it is extremely important to know the big-O complexity of the different matrix operations.  Immediately from the definitions of the operations, assuming $A,B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and $x,y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ we have the the following complexities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Inner product $x^Ty$: $O(n)$</li>
  <li>Matrix-vector product $Ax$: $O(n^2)$</li>
  <li>Matrix-matrix product $AB$: $O(n^3)$</li>
  <li>Matrix inverse $A^{-1}$, or matrix solve $A^{-1}y$ (as we will emphasize below, these are arctually done differently; they both have the same big-O omplexity, but different concstant terms on the runtime in practice): $O(n^3)$</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the big-O complexity along with the associative property of matrix multiplications implies very different complexities for computing the exact same term in different ways.  For example, suppose we want to compute the matrix products $ABx$.  We could compute this as $(AB)x$ (computing the $AB$ product first, then multiplying with $x$); this approach would have complexity $O(n^3)$, as the matrix-matrix product would dominate the computation.  On the other hand, if we compute the product as $A(Bx)$ (first computing the vector product $Bx$, which produces a vector, then multiplying this by $A$), the complex is only $O(n^2)$, as we just have two matrix-vector products.  As you can imagine, these orders of operations therefore make a huge difference in terms of the time complexity of linear algebra operations.</p>

<h2 id="numpy-and-software-for-matrices">Numpy and software for matrices</h2>

<p>The Numpy library is the defacto standard for manipulating matrices and vectors (and higher order tensors) from within Python.  Numpy <code class="highlighter-rouge">ndarray</code> objects are fundamentally multi-dimensional arrays, but the library also includes a variety of functions for processing these like matrices/vectors.  A key aspect of this library is that numpy matrices vectors are stored efficiently in memory, not via Python lists, and the operations in numpy are back by efficiently implemented linear algebra libraries.</p>

<p>A more complete tutorial on numpy is available here: <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html">Numpy tutorial</a>.  But these notes will introduce you to some of the basic operations you’re likely to see repeatedly in many data science applications.</p>

<h3 id="specialized-linear-algebra-libraies">Specialized linear algebra libraies</h3>

<p>As you will hopefully appreciate throughout this course, linear algebra computations underly virtually all data science and machine learning algorithms.  Thus, making these algorithms fast is extremely important in practical applications.  And despite the seeming “simplicity” of basic linear algebra operators, the naive implementation of most algorithms will perform quite poorly.  Consider the following (in C) implementation of a matrix multiplication operator.</p>

<p>In some sense, it seems like this <em>has</em> to be the implementation of matrix multiply; it is just a simple translation of the mathematical definition to code.  But if you compiled this code, and profile it against an optimized linear algebra library, you can expect about 10 <em>times</em> slower performance.  How is this happening?</p>

<p>It turns out that (precisely because linear algebra is so crucial), specialized linear algebra libraries (these include, for instance, <a href="http://www.openblas.net/">OpenBLAS</a>, <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl">Intel MKL</a>, <a href="http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/">ATLAS</a> or <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/">Eigen</a>) have gone to great lengths to exploit the custom vector processors, plus the cache hierarchy of specific architectures, to make libraries that are well-tuned to each different CPU (for example, they typically use “chunking” methods to break down matrix multiplications into smaller pieces that are better suited to exploit cache locality).  And the difference in speed between these and the more naive algorithms are extremely striking.</p>

<p>This is also one of the reasons why we recommend that everyone still Anaconda as their Python distribution.  Anaconda comes with versions of Numpy that are compiled with a fast linear algebra library backing it.  Chances are, if you compile your Numpy library locally, you will not link to these fast libraries, and the speed of your matrix-based code will suffer substantially from it.</p>

<p>To check to see if Numpy is using specialized libraries, use the command:</p>

<h3 id="indexing-into-numpy-arrays">Indexing into numpy arrays</h3>

<p>You can index into Numpy arrays in many different ways.  The most common is to index into them as you would a list: using single indices and using slices, with the additional consideration that using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">:</code> character will select the entire span along that dimension.</p>

<p>Note the convention here in terms of the sizes returned: if we select a single entry, then we get back the value of that entry (not a 1D/2D array with just a singleton element).  If we select a single row or a single column from a 2D array we get a <em>1D array</em> with that row or column.  And if we select a slice and/or the entire row/column along both dimensions, we get a 2D array.  This takes a while to get used to, but if, for example, we wanted to get a <em>2D array</em> containing just the (1,1) element, we could use the code.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

</pre>

<p>Numpy also support fancier indexing with <em>integer</em> and <em>Boolean</em> indexing.  If we create another array or list of indices (that  is, for the rows in above array, this would be integers between 0-3 (inclusive)), then we can use this list of integers to select the rows/columns we want to include.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">A</span><span class="p">[[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">],:])</span>  <span class="c"># select rows 1, 2, and 3</span>

<p>Note that these integer indices do not need to be in order, nor do they have to include at most once instance of each row/column; we can use this notation to repeat rows/columns too.</p>

</pre>

<p>Last, we can also use Boolean indexing.  If we specify a list or array of booleans that is the <em>same size</em> as the corresponding row/column, then the Boolean values specify a “mask” over which values are taken.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">A</span><span class="p">[[</span><span class="bp">False</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">False</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">],:])</span>  <span class="c"># Select 1st and 3rd rows</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<pre>
[[ 4  5  6]
 [10 11 12]]

</pre>

<p>As a final note, be careful if you try to use integer or boolean indexing for both dimensions.  This will attempt to select generate a 1D array of entries with both those locations.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">A</span><span class="p">[[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">],[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]])</span>    <span class="c"># the same as np.array([A[2,1], A[1,2], A[2,0]])</span>

<p>You can transpose arrays, but note this <em>only</em> has meaning for 2D (or higher) arrays.  Transposing a 1D array doesn’t do anything, since Numpy has no notion of column vectors vs. row vectors for 1D arrays.</p>

<h3 id="broadcasting">Broadcasting</h3>

<p>Things start to get very fun when you add/substract/multiply/divide array of <em>different</em> sizes.  Rather than throw an error, Numpy will try to make sense of your operation using the <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/basics.broadcasting.html">Numpy broadcasting rules</a>.  This is an advanced topic, which often really throws off newcomers to Numpy, but with a bit of practice the rules become quite intuitive.</p>

<p>Broadcasting generally refers to how entries from the small array are “broadcast” to the larger array.  The basic rule is as follows: first, suppose that two Numpy arrays <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">B</code> have the same number of dimensions (e.g., they are both 2D arrays).  But suppose that along one of these dimensions <code class="highlighter-rouge">B</code> is only size 1. In that case, the the dimension of size 1 is <code class="highlighter-rouge">B</code> is automatically expanded (repeating all entries along that dimension), and then the operation between the two arrays is applied.  Let’s look at a simple example:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">A</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ones</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">))</span>          <span class="c"># A is 4x3</span>
<span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">array</span><span class="p">([[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]])</span>      <span class="c"># x is 1x3</span>
<span class="n">A</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span>                          <span class="c"># repeat x along dimension 4 (repeat four times), and add to A</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Effectively, the (1,3) array <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> (observer that it is actually a 2D array) is “resized” to (4,3), repeating its entries along the first dimension, and it is them multiplied elementwise by <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code>.  The effective result of this is that the columns of <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> are rescaled by the values of <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code>.  Note that no actual additional memory allocation happens, and the resize here is entirely from a conceptual perspective.  Alternatively, the following code would rescale the <em>rows</em> of <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> by <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> (where here we need to construct a (4,1) sized array is order for the broadcasting to work.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">array</span><span class="p">([[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">],[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">],[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">],[</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]])</span>
<span class="n">A</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> has size (4,1), so it is effectively resized to (4,3) along the second dimension, repeating values along the columns.  This has the effect of scaling the rows of <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> by <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code>.</p>

<p>As a final note, the rule for numpy is that if the two arrays being operated upon have <em>different</em> numbers of dimensions, we extend the dimensions in the <em>leading</em> dimensions to all implicitly be 1.  Thus, the following code will implicitly consider <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> (which is a 1D array of size 3), to be a (1,3) array, and then apply the broadcasting rules, which thus has the same effect as our first broadcasting example.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">array</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="n">A</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we want to implicitly “cast” a n sized 1D array to a (n,1) sized array, we can use the notation <code class="highlighter-rouge">x[:,None]</code> (we put “None” for the dimensions we want to define to be 1).</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">array</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">[:,</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="s">"</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>These rules can be confusing, and it takes some time to get used to them, but the advantage of broadcasting is that you can compute many operations quite efficiently, and once you get used to the notation, it is actually not the difficult to understand what is happening.  For example, from a “linear algebra” perspective, the right way to scale the column of a matrix is a matrix multiplication by a diagonal matrix, like in the following code.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">D</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">diag</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">array</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]))</span>
<span class="n">A</span> <span class="err">@</span> <span class="n">D</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(we will cover the matrix multiplication operator <code class="highlighter-rouge">@</code> in a moment).  However, actually constructing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">np.diag()</code> matrix is wasteful: it explicitly constructs an $n \times n$ matrix that only has non-zero elements on the diagonal, then performs a dense matrix multiplication.  It is much more efficient to simply scale <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> using the broadcasting method above, as no additional storage will be allocated, and the actual scaling operation only requires $O(n^2)$ time as opposed to the $O(n^3)$ time for a full matrix multiplication.</p>

<h3 id="linear-algebra-operations">Linear algebra operations</h3>

<p>Starting with Python 3, there is now a matrix multiplication operator <code class="highlighter-rouge">@</code> defined between numpy arrays (previously one had to use the more cumbersome <code class="highlighter-rouge">np.dot()</code> function to accomplish the same thing).  Note that in the following example, all the array sizes are created such that the matrix multiplications work.</p>

<p>There is an important point to note, though, here. Depending on the sizes of the arrays passed to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">@</code> operator, numpy will return results of different sizes: two 2D arrays result in a 2D array (matrix-matrix product), a 2D array and a 1D array result in a 1D array (matrix-vector product), and two 1D arrays result in a scalar (just a floating point number, not an <code class="highlighter-rouge">ndarray</code> at all).  This can cause some issues if, for instance, your code always assumes that the result of a <code class="highlighter-rouge">@</code> operation between two <code class="highlighter-rouge">ndarray</code> objects will also return an <code class="highlighter-rouge">ndarray</code>: depending on the size of the arrays you pass (i.e., if they are both 1D arrays), you will actually get a floating point object, not an <code class="highlighter-rouge">ndarray</code> at all.</p>

<p>The rules can be especially confusing when we think about multiplying vectors on the left of matrices, i.e., forming a matrix-vector product $y^T A$ for $y \in \mathbb{R}^m$, $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$.  This is a valid matrix product, but since Numpy has no distinction between column and row vectors, both the following operations compute the same 1D result (i.e., which performs the above left-multplication, but return the result just as a 1D array):</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">A</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">T</span> <span class="err">@</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>The confusing part is that because transposes have no meaning to for 1D arrays, the following code <em>also</em> returns the same result, despite $y A$ not being a valid linear algebra expression.</p>

<p>On the other hand, trying to do the multiplication in the other order $Ay$ (which is also not a valid linear algebra expression), does throw an error.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">A</span> <span class="err">@</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These are oddities that you will get used to, and while I initially thought that the notation for everything here was rather counter-intuitive, it actually does make sense (in some respect) why everything was implemented this way.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: in an attempt to “fix” these problems, the Numpy library also contains an <code class="highlighter-rouge">np.matrix</code> class (where everything is represented as a 2D matrix, with row and column vectors explicit, and the multiplication operator <code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code> overloaded to perform matrix multiplication).  Don’t use this class.  The issue is that 1) when you want to perform <em>non-matrix</em> operations, you need to cast them back to <code class="highlighter-rouge">np.ndarray</code> objects, which creates very cumbersome code; and 2) most function and external libraries return <code class="highlighter-rouge">ndarray</code> objects anyway.  There are, somewhat annoyingly, some collection of Numpy functions (and especially Scipy functions) that <em>do</em> return <code class="highlighter-rouge">np.matrix</code> objects, and the one function you’ll need to know is <code class="highlighter-rouge">np.asarray()</code>, which casts them back to arrays while not performing any matrix copies.  For example, the sparse matrix routines that we will see shortly have a function <code class="highlighter-rouge">.todense()</code> that returns dense version of the matrix but as an <code class="highlighter-rouge">np.matrix</code> object.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">scipy.sparse</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">sp</span>

<p>Let’s also look at what we mentioned above, considering the order of matrix multiplications in terms of time complexity.

<p>This performs the matrix products $(AB)x$, which computes the inefficient matrix multiplication first.  If we want to compute the product in the much more efficient order $A(Bx)$, we would use the command</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">%</span><span class="n">timeit</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="err">@</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">B</span> <span class="err">@</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>However, you should <em>not</em> do this.

For those who are curious (you won’t need to know this for this class, but it can be useful to understand), this is because performing the solve internally actually computes a <em>factorization</em> of the matrix called the LU factorization: it decomposes $A$ into the matrix product $A = LU$ where $L$ is a lower triangular matrix (all entries above the diagonal are zero), and $U$ is an upper triangular matrix (all entries below the diagonal are zero); if we want to be even more precise it actually computes the LU factorization on a version of $A$ with permuted rows and columns, but that is definitely beyond the scope of this course.  After factorizing $A$ in this manner, it computes the inverse</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A^{-1} b = (L U)^{-1} b = U^{-1} L^{-1} b</script>

<p>In turns out that computing the product $L^{-1} b$ (again, not actually explicitly computing the inverse of $A$, just computing the solve) for a triangular matrix is very efficient, it just takes $O(n^2)$ operations instead of $O(n^3)$ operations as for a generic matrix.  This means that once we compute the factorization $A = LU$ (which does itself take $O(n^3)$ time, as a note, which is why matrix solves are $O(n^3)$ complexity), solving for the right hand size $b$ is “easy”.</p>

<p>In fact the way that we compute the inverse is by first computing the LU factorization and then “solving” for the right hand side $I$.  But obviously if we just want to ultimately solve for a single right hand size $b$, this is an unnecessary step, and it introduces additional error into the computation.  For this reason, you will almost ways prefer to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">np.linalg.solve()</code> unless to really need elements of the inverse itself (and not just to multiply the inverse by some expression).</p>

<h2 id="sparse-matrices">Sparse matrices</h2>
<p>The last topic we will touch on, which at our level of discussion will relate more to the representation of matrices than the linear algebra behind it, is the concept of sparse matrices.  Many problems in data science deal with matrix representations that are inherently <em>sparse</em> (that is, they contain a majority of zero elements, with only a few non-zeros).  For example, in the two forthcoming lectures, we will discuss graphs and free text modeling.  As we will see, a primary method for representing graphs will be the adjacency matrix, a matrix that has as a non-zero element in location $i,j$ if there is an edge between node $i$ and node $j$; many natural graphs have only a small number of nodes connected to each other, so the resulting adjacency matrix is sparse.  Similarly, in free text modeling it is common to represent documents via a “bag of words” model, where we represent each document as a large vector that that indicates which words occur in the document; since typical documents only contain a small fraction of all possible words, this “word-document co-occurrence” matrix is usually sparse.</p>

<p>While of course it is possible to represent a sparse matrix using the standard dense format specified above, doing so is quite wasteful from both a space and time complexity standpoint; explicitly representing (and multiplying by) many zeros is both a waste of memory and computation.  Because of this, when matrices have a significant number of zero entries, it makes sense that we should somehow exploit this fact to reduce memory consumption and speed up computation.  Fortunately, there are a large collection of sparse matrix libraries that accomplish these goals exactly.  While we of course won’t have the ability to go into how these libraries work in any real detail (especially for the more complex operations like sparse matrix-matrix multiplies (already hard enough of a problem to do “easily”) let alone more complex operations like sparse matrix factorizations (where there is a whole subfield dedicated to such algorithms).  The good news, though, is that from a pure mathematical standpoint, sparse matrices naturally behave just like dense matrices (matrix multiplication, inversion, etc, all have the same syntax); really, these are fundamentally a <em>computational</em> tool, and with a slight understanding of how sparse matrices function, you can make fairly good use of the libraries even if you don’t initially know all the details behind the algorithms.</p>

<h3 id="sparse-data-formats">Sparse data formats</h3>
<p>The first and primary element we will highlight is the <em>data formats</em> used to specify sparse matrices.  Unlike dense matrices, where there is a natural way to represent elements in memory (though even there we had the column-major/row-major choice), there are many different ways we can represent sparse matrices, and different approaches are better suited to different tasks.  Understanding these formats is a starting point to learning to use sparse matrix libraries, and will also draw connections to later topics we discuss.  In these notes we will cover two of the most common formats you’ll encounter: the coordinate (COO) format, and the compressed sparse column (CSC) format.  Most other formats have some similarity to these, so they serve as a good starting point to understanding sparse matrices.</p>

<p><strong>Coordinate (COO) format.</strong> Perhaps the most natural way to express a sparse matrix is by a “list” of (row, column, value) tuples; because we know that only very few locations will actually have non-zero entries, this format lets us just express the entries that exist, where all other entries that are not specified are assumed to be zero.  This is in fact essentially exactly the intuition behind the coordinate (commonly abbreviated COO, despite the fact that it is not an acronym) format for sparse matrices.  In coo format, we use three 1D arrays to specify a matrix, a <code class="highlighter-rouge">row_indices</code> array, a <code class="highlighter-rouge">col_indices</code> array, and a <code class="highlighter-rouge">values</code> array.  These contain exactly what you would expect.  For each non-zero entry in the matrix is there a corresponding element in these vectors that specifies the row, column, and value of that matrix.  Let’s consider the example matrix</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
A \in \mathbb{R}^{4\times 4} = \left [ \begin{array}{cccc}
0 & 0 & 3 & 0 \\
2 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
4 & 0 & 1 & 0
\end{array} \right ]. %]]></script>

<p>A COO representation of this matrix could be (this is just specifying generic arrays, not in any particular language):</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">values</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">row_indices</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">column_indices</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Although here we ordered the entries in these arrays in a “column-major” fashion, COO format has no such requirements: we could specify the elements of the matrix in any order we desire (and even have duplicate entires, where the true value is assumed to be the sum of all entries correspond to a particular row and column).  The size of all these entries will be equal to the number of nonzeros in <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code>, a number which will refer to as $\mathrm{nnz}$ when we need to use it notationally.  Finally, not that in addition to the entries in the above matrices, we would also need to store the actual size of the array (number of rows $m$ and columns $n$ respectively), to cover the  case where we have additional rows/columns of all zeros.</p>

<p>The advantage of the COO format is that it is good for constructing sparse matrices; because items can be stored in any order to add a new element the matrix, we simply append an entry to the arrays (depending on how these arrays are stored, you would typically “pre-allocate” a bit of extra storage, resizing the arrays as needed, just like Python does with its lists, if you expect to be frequently adding elements).  On the flipside, it is quite back for <em>inspecting</em> sparse matrices.  Suppose we wanted to look up the value <code class="highlighter-rouge">A[i,j]</code> in a sparse matrix in COO format.  Because elements can be in any order, we would have no option but to perform a linear scan through the entire arrays, to see if any row/column pair matched <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code>/<code class="highlighter-rouge">j</code>, with complexity $O(n)$ (where here say that the matrix is $n \times n$).</p>

<p>If the matrix in COO format was always maintained in column-major order, as described above, then this complexity could be reduced to $O(\log n)$ via binary search on the column indices; however, maintaining it in this order would also remove our ability to easily add new elements to matrix, because we would need to shift items in the various arrays (i.e., by copying the memory to a later location) whenever a new element was added.  And if we’re willing to make this sacrifice, it turns out there is a better way to store the matrix, described next.</p>

<p><strong>Compressed sparse column (CSC) format.</strong> The downsides of the above approach motivate a different matrix storage, where we <em>do</em> explicitly maintain a column-major ordering of the non-zero entries.  However, if we are going to do so, then it turns out we actually get a more efficient structure if we change the nature of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">column_indices</code> array.  Instead of an $\mathrm{nnz}$-dimensional array containing the column index of each entry, we make the array be a $(n+1)$-dimenional array (remember that $n$ is the number of columns in the matrix), pointing to the <em>index</em> of the starting location for each column in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">row_indices</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">values</code> array.</p>

<p>This is a bit hard to understand at first, so an example can make things more understandable.  Instead of the COO format above, the CSC format consists of the arrays</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">values</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">row_indices</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">column_indices</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s unpack this a bit.  The fact that <code class="highlighter-rouge">column_indices</code> has a 5 in element 3 (remember, we are assuming zero indexing), means that the index-3 column (really the forth column) starts at index 5 in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">row_indices</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">values</code> arrays; the fact that <code class="highlighter-rouge">column_indices</code> has a 2 in element 1 means that the index-1 column (really the second column) starts at index 2 in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">row_indices</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">values</code> arrays.</p>

<p>The advantage to this format is that it is extremely efficient to look up <em>all</em> the entries in a given column $i$.  If we want to know the entries of column <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code>, we would use simply get the slice (using Python notation here)</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">values</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">column_indices</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]:</span><span class="n">column_indices</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(the same could be done to get the row indices).  This also hopefully clarifies why the <code class="highlighter-rouge">column_indices</code> array contains $n+1$ entries: so that we can always use the range <code class="highlighter-rouge">column_indices[i]:column_indices[i+1]</code> to get all the items in the column (the last entry in <code class="highlighter-rouge">column_indices</code> must therefore be equal to the number of non-zero elements in the matrix.</p>

<p>As is hopefully apparent, CSC format is typically much better than COO for quickly accessing elements, especially accessing single rows in the matrix (there is a corresponding compressed sparse row (CSR) that does the exact same thing but row-wise, for quick access to rows).  But conversely, it is very poor at adding new elements to the array (this requires shifting all subsequent items in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">row_indices</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">values</code> columns, and incrementing subsequent elements in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">column_indices</code> array).</p>

<h3 id="basics-of-sparse-matrix-computation">Basics of sparse matrix computation</h3>

<p>The above discussion hopefully makes it fairly obvious why sparse matrices are a good idea from a storage standpoint: instead of storing $mn$ elements for an $m \times n$, we can store $3\cdot\mathrm{nnz}$ arrays (we ignore storing $m$ and $n$, because you actually need to do this for both sparse and dense matrices anyway) for COO format, or $2\cdot\mathrm{nnz} + n + 1$ elements for CSC format.</p>

<p>But why are sparse matrices also more computationally efficient.  To give a brief sense of this, let’s consider one of the most ubiquitous operations in linear algebra, the product of a (dense or sparse) matrix with a (dense) vector $Ax$ for $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$.  This operation will be $O(mn)$ if we represent $A$ densely (this follows immediately from the definition of the matrix-vector product).  But what about if we represent $A$ COO sparse format.  In this case, the algorithm for matrix-vector products is fairly simple</p>

<ol>
  <li>Initialize $y = 0$</li>
  <li>For each $(i,j,v)$ in $A$:
    <ul>
      <li>Set $y_i := y_i + x_j \cdot v$</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>After running the algorithm, $y = Ax$, as this is exactly equivalent to the traditional definition of matrix-vector products, we are just accumulating the sum for each individual tuple in $A$ represented in COO form (if the above algorithm isn’t apparent to you, try to derive it directly from the definition of the COO format and the definition of matrix multiplication above).  Beacuse this algorithm obviously only loops over the non-zero entries of $A$ once, it rquires only $O(\mathrm{nnz})$ operations, a potentially significant reduction.</p>

<p>We can also write a similar routine for matrices in CSC format, though we leave that out here for simplicit. As a general rule of thumb, you should use sparse matrices for matrix-vector multiplication if your matrix is 80% zero or (there due to the 2-3x more storage needed, and the fact that the matrix-vector products are usually a little less cache efficient than purely dense operations).  If your operations involve matrix solves, then a better rule of this is that you need 95% sparsity or more (operations related to matrix solves actually decrease sparsity of the intermediate components we compute).  This last rule of thumb, though, actually depends on the precise sparsity pattern of the data (if the sparsity is truly random, it woudl actually require much higher degrees of sparsity to make matrix sovles worth it, but for reasons we won’t go into, many “realstic” matrices have structure that makes the sparse solve more efficient than the worst case.</p>

<h3 id="python-sparse-matrix-libraries">Python sparse matrix libraries</h3>

<p>The standard library for manipulating sparse matrices with Python is the <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html">scipy.sparse</a> module.  The library supports several different types of sparse matrix formats (along with operations for converting betweeen the different types), and interfaces with well-established third-party code for all needed linear algebra functions.</p>

<p>Let’s briefly look at how to construct a sparse matrix in <code class="highlighter-rouge">scipy.sparse</code> (we can convert to a dense matrix by calling the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.todense()</code> function, though of course this should only be done on small instances).</p>

<p>For a CSC matrix, the values are in still in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.data</code> pointer, but the row indices and column indices (as we used the terms), are in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.indices</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">.indptr</code> arrays; again, this are all just numpy arrays, that internally store the actual data of the matrix.</p>

<p>As a final example, let’s create a 1000x1000 sparse matrix with 99.9% sparsity plus an identity matrix (we’ll do this with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sp.rand</code> call, which randomly chooses entries to fill in, and then makes samples them from a uniform distribution … we add the identity to make the matrix likely to be invertible).  The precise nature of the matrix isn’t important here, we just want to consider the timing.</p>

<p>Here the sparse version is about 50x faster, though of course the speedup will increase with sparsity relative to the dense matrix.</p>

</pre>

<p>Similarly, the sparse version is about 20x faster.  You can try to experiment to see where the break-even point for the sparse/dense tradeoff is, but as mentioned above, for matrix inverses this is going to be very problem specific, so you won’t get too much insight until you start using real data.</p>
